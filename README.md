*A Game Boy emulator (wannabe)*

This project is supposed to be a learning experience and does not claim to be useful to anyone for any other purpose than to learn some more Haskell.
Anyway if this thing ends up working anywhere similarly to an actual emulator it won't hurt.

Feel free to suggest papers, libraries, books or places to travel to.
